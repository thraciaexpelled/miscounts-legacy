## Building
I've decided that I won't use my [build system](https://github.com/gushtichudi/build.py) for this. Makefile is used.

### Dependencies
The needed dependencies are already installed in `deps/` by the C package manager, [clib](https://github.com/clibs/clib).

## Known Bugs and oddities

*Currently none.*
